# Ansible Roles to Setup Web Server

## About
Use these roles on your own risk. They are not intended for public use.
I designed them for my own needs.

## Installation:

- `pip install -U mazer`
- `pip install -U --pre ansible` (must be >= 2.8)
- `mazer install --namespace lorien git+https://github.com/lorien/cluster`
